    <h2>Reflection on Fall Quarter 2024 DESN 368</h2>
    <div class="reflection">
        <h3>Important and Key Experiences</h3>
        <p class="des">Identify two important learning experiences and/or "a-ha" moments you during this class. </p>
        <p>Answer: One a-ha moment I had was when working with the id and classes in html/css.
             I never really used them and when I learned how to use them, it made my life so much easier.
             Another thing I learned was how to use the flex box in css.
            I never understood it that much, still am sometimes, but it makes life so much easier.</p>

        <h3>What do you know now that you didn't know in January?</h3>
        <p class="des">Write a few brief phrases or sentences regarding what you learned, why it is/was important to you and what the outcome was. </p>
        <p>Answer: I know a lot going into this class but never expectied to learn so much.
            All the little deiails that I learn help me code faster and more efficiently.
            FreeCodeCamp is super nice and really made me remebmer key things.
        </p>
        <h3>What Worked?</h3>
        <p class="des">List 3 bests from this class this quarter</p>
        <p>Answer: FreeCodeCamp, Netlify, and Letting us do a lot of hands on.</p>
        <h3>What Didn't Work?</h3>
        <p class="des">List 3 worsts from this class this quarter</p>
        <p>Answer: No real worstes but FreeCodeCamp being annoying, I never really used CodePen but I'm sure others loved it, and 
            in the beginning there was a lot of assigments that were hard to keep up with.
        </p>
        <h3>Change and Growth</h3>
        <p class="des">Describe 3 experiences when you learned something that changed how you thought about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="des">Thinking:<br></li>
          <p>Answer: There are many wasys of doing the same thing. Every assigment made me thing about this.</p>
          <li class="des">Design:<br></li>
            <p>Answer: Diffrent designs and diffrent ways of implemeting it. Like insted of underlining making it a thinner font.</p>
          <li class="des">Education:<br></li>
            <p>Answer: Slowing down and remebmering diffrent things, FreeCodeCamp made me do that.</p>
            <li class="des">Learning:<br></li>
            <p>Answer: Start early and make it nice. Every assigment.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>What work was challenging?</h3>
        <p class="des">Explain 3 experiences this quarter when you had to overcome some kind of obstacle, failure, challenge or resistance in order to continue you learning journey. </p>
        <p>Answer: Not a lot to overcome, the CS department really taught us to learn fast and overcome.
            One thing was always having to do research on how to do something, I never really did that before.
            Another thing taking my time and not rushing through the assigments. I learned a lot more when I took my time.
            And lastly, FreeCodeCamp just had me stumped so many times and really had me frustrated. But I took a break and came back and it was all good.
        </p>
